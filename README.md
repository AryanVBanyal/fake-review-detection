Fake Review Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a system to detect fake reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as either genuine or fake based on various features extracted from the text.

Features
Text Classification: Identifies whether a review is fake or genuine.
Feature Extraction: Extracts features from text data to aid in classification.
Model Training and Evaluation: Uses machine learning algorithms to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Visualization: Provides insights into the performance of the model with visualizations.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk or spaCy
matplotlib or seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for development)
